# Practice Log - February 17, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Am pentatonic scale with metronome, worked up to 120bpm clean (5 min)
- Basic blues riff (5 min)
- Power chord practice (15 min)

## Wins
- Showed up despite a sore back -- short sessions still count
- 120bpm clean on Am pentatonic is solid
- Turned a 10-minute "just show up" session into 25 minutes

## Needs Work
- Nothing new -- this was a maintenance session

## Notes
- Back was sore, kept it seated. Sometimes just picking up the guitar is the win -- and then you end up playing for longer than you planned.
