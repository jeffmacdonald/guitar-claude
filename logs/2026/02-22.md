# Practice Log - February 22, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Jam session with Jon (20+ years experience) -- about 2 hours
- Bits and pieces from the BNL Gordon album (multiple songs)
- Wheat Kings by the Tragically Hip

## Wins
- Two hours of playing with an experienced musician is worth a lot -- different energy than solo practice
- Jon's tips landed well: slow down, leave space, let the words carry weight
- Gordon is already on the long-term radar -- this session put real songs to that goal
- Wheat Kings too -- another one from the goals list, now with some actual hands-on time

## Needs Work
- Slowing down instinct -- tendency to push the tempo rather than sit in it
- Leaving room in the arrangement -- resist filling every space; the lyrics need room to breathe
- These songs are long-term projects, not one-session wins; keep returning to them

## Notes
- Jon's core advice: slow down and let the words do the heavy lifting. Worth internalizing broadly, not just for these songs.
- Gordon album as a full project is on the goals list -- this session is a good first poke at it
- Playing with experienced players is its own kind of lesson; do this more when the opportunity comes up
