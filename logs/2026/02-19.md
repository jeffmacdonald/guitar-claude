# Practice Log - February 19, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Power chords (extended session)
- Basic blues riff
- Basic string bending

## Wins
- 45 minutes of solid work -- good session length
- Combining power chords, blues riff, and bending in one session is exactly the blues module consolidation work

## Needs Work
- Keep refining bending intonation -- hitting the target pitch cleanly takes time
- Keep the blues riff tight and rhythmic, not just noodling

## Notes
- Evening session. Power chords + blues riff + bending is a good combo -- they all live in the same blues/rock space and reinforce each other.
