# Practice Log - March 1, 2026

## Session Duration
~2 hours (approx 12:30–14:30 AST)

## Week of Feb 23–28 (informal, catch-up note)
- Picked up guitar here and there -- no structured sessions
- Dialed in Positive Grid presets, narrowed down to the ones that work
- Blues licks from Marty Music (fun, no pressure)
- Power chord strumming

## What We Worked On

### Block 1 -- Warm Up (~20 min)
- Power chord run: Basket Case (Green Day) alongside Blink-182 and Bloodhound Gang
- Power chords are useful training but not the core direction right now -- acknowledged as skill-building, not the goal

### Block 2 -- Module 16: Melodies & Moving Chords (~35 min)
- Watched first Justin Guitar Module 16 video: "Supercharge Your Practice with Time Boxing"
- Em and Am scales while watching
- Fretboard note naming practice
- **Lightbulb: Learn natural notes first (skip sharps/flats), anchor on BC and EF half-step gaps**
- **Lightbulb: Em pentatonic open position looks different because the root is an open string -- now that makes sense**

### Block 3 -- House of the Rising Sun (~15 min)
- Drilled the 6/8 arpeggio pattern (looked up a beginner-focused YouTube video, clicked well)
- Switched to acoustic mid-block for F chord strength work
- Picking and strumming both in play; transitions between them still in progress

### Block 4 -- Blues, YouTube, and Fun (~50 min)
- Blues licks and noodling
- Watched several YouTube videos
- Explored Justin Guitar Module 16 practice routine suggestions

## Wins
- Two genuine lightbulb moments on fretboard note naming and Em pentatonic open position
- House of the Rising Sun 6/8 pattern is clicking
- F chord: decent on electric, barred B and E still fuzzing on acoustic -- but noticeably better than a month ago
- Module 16 is open and underway -- Melodies & Moving Chords sounds like the right direction

## Needs Work
- F chord barre on acoustic: finger closer to the fret, check angle and pressure point
- Picking-to-strumming transitions in House of the Rising Sun -- still in separate blocks, goal is natural handoffs
- Time boxing discipline -- the structure is understood, execution is the gap
- Bending intonation (carry-over from recent sessions)

## Notes
- Not really here for distorted power chord rock right now -- useful training but not the core vibe
- Marty Music is the right outlet when the blues/fun itch strikes between structured sessions
- Strumming SOS is high on the radar -- keep it in mind for next session planning
- Jon's advice from Feb 22 still resonates: slow down, leave space, let the words breathe
- Playing with other guitarists is its own kind of lesson -- keep chasing those opportunities
