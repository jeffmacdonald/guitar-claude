# Practice Log - February 4, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Justin Guitar Grade 4 Blues Lead videos (~35 min)
- Freddie King lick from the Blues Licks app

## Wins
- Dedicated blues lead session -- building that vocabulary
- Four sessions in a week -- consistency streak continues

## Needs Work
- Keep drilling the Freddie King lick until it's automatic
- Blues phrasing and bending

## Notes
- Self-directed session focused entirely on blues lead playing
- Grade 4 content is a step up -- good stretch
