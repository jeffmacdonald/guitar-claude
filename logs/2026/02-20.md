# Practice Log - February 20, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Power chords (continued from last night)

## Wins
- Back-to-back days on power chords -- repetition is how these get locked in
- Morning session means the day started with guitar

## Needs Work
- Keep working on clean muting between chord changes -- avoid string noise
- Push tempo gradually once changes feel automatic

## Notes
- Short morning session. Consistency over length -- two days in a row on power chords is doing the work.

## Evening Session (~40 min)

### What We Worked On
- Power chords (continued from morning)
- Blink-182 songs
- Bloodhound Gang songs

### Wins
- Two sessions in one day -- morning and evening
- Applying power chords to actual songs is exactly how they get locked in

### Notes
- Punk/pop-punk is a great power chord sandbox -- fast changes, simple shapes, high energy
