# Practice Log - January 29, 2026

## What We Worked On
- One-minute chord changes (weakest transitions) + Am pentatonic warm-up
- F chord transition drill: C to F, Am to F, Dm to F -- focus on clean fretting
- Song work (10 min block)
- Cool-down with something fun

## Wins
- Solid 20-minute structured session -- felt more focused than just noodling
- Has been doing consistent metronome strumming and scale work on his own
- Working open 7th chords into regular practice
- Tackled barre F to barre Bm transition head-on

## Needs Work
- F to Bm barre chord transition -- different barre shapes across frets, needs reps
- Keep drilling F chord from multiple entry points

## Notes
- Shorter session (20 min) but well-structured -- proof that focused short sessions work
- Jeff's been self-directing practice well lately (metronome, scales, open 7s)
- Consider making F-to-Bm a standing drill item for the next few sessions
