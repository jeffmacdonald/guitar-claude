# Practice Log - January 30, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Warm-up: Blues shuffle strumming on open E and Am, which evolved into its own thing -- then E and A
- Drunken Sailor (Em/D) via Good Guitarist tutorial -- ~20 minutes learning and playing through it
- Blues improv jamming over two YouTube backing tracks (~12 min total), using E blues scale

## Wins
- Em/D changes feel smooth -- Drunken Sailor clicked fast
- Improvising over backing tracks for 12 minutes straight -- that's real playing
- Practice consistency is clearly paying off; things are landing quicker than expected
- Fun, loose Friday session -- good balance of learning something new and just playing

## Needs Work
- Blues scale vocabulary is still basic -- keep jamming over backing tracks to build phrases
- F to Bm barre transition still on the list from yesterday

## Notes
- Jeff's noticing progress he wasn't tracking -- a sign that regular practice is compounding
- Drunken Sailor is a good add to the repertoire: simple, fun, singable
- Jeff really enjoyed the backing track improv -- make this a regular part of sessions going forward
- Consider bookmarking backing tracks that feel good to jam over for repeat use
