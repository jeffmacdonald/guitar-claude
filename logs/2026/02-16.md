# Practice Log - February 16, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Warm-up: Am pentatonic at 100 bpm, which evolved into extended noodling -- picked out the melody for Fear is the Mind Killer (Jesse Welles), bits of Tennessee Whiskey, and Wish You Were Here
- Walking bass reps: C→Am, G→Em, D→A chromatic walks
- 12-bar shuffle riff (BG-1306) -- watched the lesson and got it moving
- F and barre chord transitions: C→F, Am→F, F→Bm, then C→F→Bm→Am loop
- Cool-down: Mad World from the Justin app
- ~30 min session

## Wins
- Shuffle riff clicked -- got it moving on the first real attempt
- Walking bass getting reps in back-to-back sessions (concept clicked Saturday, now building muscle memory)
- Barre transitions feeling good -- consistent drilling is paying off
- Picking out melodies by ear during noodling (Fear is the Mind Killer, Tennessee Whiskey, Wish You Were Here)

## Needs Work
- Walking bass lines -- keep repping, they need to become automatic
- Shuffle riff -- keep it in rotation, build speed and feel
- F→Bm still an ongoing drill

## Notes
- The warm-up-turns-into-noodling pattern is real but not a problem -- it's playing, and he's picking up melodies naturally
- Fear is the Mind Killer is on the repertoire list -- the fact that he's already gravitating toward it means it's a good candidate to learn properly soon
- Mad World (from the Maybe list) got a spin via the Justin app -- worth noting if interest grows
- Back-to-back days (Feb 15 + 16) -- good momentum
