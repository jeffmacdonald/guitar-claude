# Practice Log - February 21, 2026

## What We Worked On
- House of the Rising Sun -- ~1 hour session with Ewan (trombone)
- Jeff on Telecaster with Positive Grid tone dialed in for the song
- Mixing picking and strumming -- doing stretches of each, not yet blending them smoothly

## Wins
- Family jam -- playing alongside Ewan on trombone is real ensemble experience
- House of the Rising Sun covers Am, C, D, F, E -- all chords Jeff knows; right in his wheelhouse
- An hour of playing with someone else builds ears differently than solo practice
- Getting both picking and strumming into the same song is the right direction

## Needs Work
- Smooth transitions between picking and strumming within the song -- right now doing one then the other in blocks; the goal is to flow between them more naturally
- The arpeggio picking pattern is the heart of the song -- worth isolating and drilling cleanly

## Notes
- Ewan plays trombone. Trombone + Telecaster on House of the Rising Sun is legitimately cool.
- The song is in Am -- fits Jeff's pentatonic and chord vocabulary perfectly
- This kind of session (playing a real song with another person) is worth repeating
