# Practice Log - February 12, 2026

## What We Worked On
- First session using the Module 15 practice format (5-min blocks)
- Block 1 - Technique/Finger Gym: warm-up
- Block 2 - Technique/Chord Linking: chromatic walking bass lines between C→Am, G→Em, D→A. Learned the tab for each walk and the alternate bass note C/G chord.
- Noodled on songs for the remaining time
- ~35 minutes total

## Wins
- Adopted the new Module 15 practice structure and actually used it
- Learned the walking bass line tabs -- now documented in `notes/chord-linking-bass-walks.md`
- Made a conscious decision to consolidate fundamentals instead of pushing ahead -- that's maturity, not retreat

## Needs Work
- Walking bass lines need a lot more reps before they're smooth
- Alternate bass C/G chord -- drill alternating the bass note while strumming
- Slash chords in general -- revisit and practice
- Start working through Blues Module 13 systematically

## Notes
- Jeff expressed the classic "want to start over from lesson 1" feeling. Reframed as consolidation, not reset.
- Updated SKILLS.md to reflect a consolidation phase focused on bass walks, blues module, slash chords, and owning fundamentals
- Created `notes/` folder for reference material (bass walk tabs)
- Week-long gap since last session (Feb 4) -- no stress, just pick back up
