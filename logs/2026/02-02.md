# Practice Log - February 2, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Warm-up: One-minute chord changes on A→F, Bm→F, A→Dm (hard pairs + a breather). Am pentatonic scale at 100 bpm, clean.
- Technique drill (~8 min): F and barre chord reps -- C→F, Am→F, F→Bm, then looping C-F-Bm-Am
- Ho Hey (Lumineers) (~15 min): Worked through a YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPU73ZMhaio). Csus4 was fine, but the strumming pattern is tricky. Justin Guitar's one-strum-per-beat version is too stripped down.
- Backing track jam on the ShittyStrat (Robson Strat copy) through Positive Grid mini amp
- Cool-down: Drunken Sailor on acoustic

## Wins
- Full ~35 min structured session -- the real deal
- Am pentatonic clean at 100 bpm
- Didn't shy away from the hardest barre transitions (A→F, Bm→F)
- Switched to electric for backing track jam -- mixing it up keeps things fresh

## Needs Work
- Ho Hey strumming pattern -- the percussive/chunky strum that gives the song its feel. Next session: isolate the verse strumming specifically.
- F→Bm barre transition (third session in a row -- keep at it)
- Blues scale vocabulary still growing

## Notes
- Jeff found his own tutorial for Ho Hey rather than settling for the basic version -- good instinct to chase the real sound
- The ShittyStrat (Robson Strat copy + Positive Grid mini) is now part of the rotation for electric jam sessions
- Drunken Sailor holding up from Friday -- it's sticking
- Three practice sessions in four days -- consistency is there
