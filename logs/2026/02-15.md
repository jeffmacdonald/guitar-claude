# Practice Log - February 15, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Warm-up: Am pentatonic at 100 bpm (2 min)
- Bass walks / chord linking: C→Am, G→Em, D→A -- broke down the concept of chromatic walking bass (finally clicked)
- F and barre chord transitions: C→F, Am→F, F→Bm
- Blues Module 13 work (details TBD on which specific focus)
- Dialing in amp tone on the new Squier Classic Vibe Telecaster -- first real session with it
- Side quests along the way
- ~30 min session

## Wins
- First session on the new Squier Classic Vibe Telecaster
- Bass walks concept clicked -- understands the "trick" (chromatic walk between root notes on the bass string)
- Covered three blocks of focused practice plus exploration
- Found an amp tone setting that works

## Needs Work
- Walking bass lines -- understand the concept now, need reps to make them smooth
- 12-bar shuffle riff (BG-1306) -- queued for next session: https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/12-bar-shuffle-riff-bg-1306
- Keep drilling F→Bm barre transitions

## Notes
- New guitar: Squier Classic Vibe Telecaster added to the rotation (acoustic, ShittyStrat, and now the Tele)
- Next session priorities: walking bass reps + 12-bar shuffle riff (BG-1306) -- don't skip these
- Tone hunting is part of the process with a new electric -- time well spent
