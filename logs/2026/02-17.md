# Practice Log - February 17, 2026

## What We Worked On
- Am pentatonic scale with metronome, worked up to 120bpm clean (5 min)
- Basic blues riff (5 min)

## Wins
- Showed up despite a sore back -- short sessions still count
- 120bpm clean on Am pentatonic is solid

## Needs Work
- Nothing new -- this was a maintenance session

## Notes
- Back was sore, kept it to a seated 10-minute session. Sometimes just picking up the guitar is the win.
