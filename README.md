# guitar-claude

A personal guitar coaching setup powered by Claude Code. This repo is the persistent memory and practice journal for Jeff's guitar journey -- started March 2025, currently working through Justin Guitar's Beginner Course.

## What's in here

- **SKILLS.md** -- The full coaching context: what Jeff knows, what he's working on, song repertoire, music taste, practice structure, and guidelines for how Claude should coach. This is the brain of the operation.
- **logs/** -- Practice journals organized by date (`logs/YYYY/MM-DD.md`). Honest, scannable notes from each session covering what we worked on, what clicked, and what needs more reps.

## How it works

Jeff opens a Claude Code session in this directory and practices guitar with Claude as his coach. Claude knows his skill level, his goals, his song list, and his taste. It structures practice sessions, suggests drills, breaks down songs, and keeps things moving without pushing past where the curriculum has him.

After each session, Claude logs what happened and pushes it here automatically. The repo is the long-term record -- a practice journal that builds over time.

## The goal

Play lots of songs. Memorize the fretboard. Keep progressing through Justin Guitar. Eventually learn to stand up while playing. Get that F chord clean every time.
